# State Of the Art Networks

This directory has the implemention of two State Of the Art Networks in the time of the writing: SPGAN and DIDNet.

Unfortunately, due to the lack of details in the original papers and the difficulty to make contact with the original authors to clarify open questions, it was not possible to fully reproduce the proposed networks. Therefore, this directory stores the proposed code but it is **not usable and is deprecated**.
